#CHANGELOGS:#

What we changed different to what your normally used to

- Set CPU Schedule Performance I/O from manual to Automatic (We set this so windows 11 can auto set.the.gonor.of.yoyr.cpu to max or power saving based on your usage)

- Added the UCMCLIENT driver for motherboards that supports it, Microsoft does not include this when installing neither the manufacture

- Removed all UWP apps except: Edge, & Microsoft Store all apps that previously installs in the normal version can be required in the MC Store.

- Improvement to RAM without updates and having NGE installed 3.0GB is being used (unless a take  of apps are running in the background)

- Onedrive is disabled by default but shows up installed anyways you can uninstall it from the control panel.

- When installing the OS fresh you do not need to enter a key, you can do that after the setup or if you already have a paid key, it can detect and use your key automatically by using your HWID  & PID

- Windows 11 Setup is now white instead of purple

- Boot times are a bit faster and opening and closing windows are faster

-  In Explorer Everytime you open explorer you will always be brought to "This PC" instead of the default stock quick access page, this way makes it easier to get to your drives

- System is update friendly you choose when to install them.

- GPU Hardware Scheduling is now enabled by default.



BEFORE YOU GET STARTED:

To get started you will need the following files/hardware to install this version of Windows 11 Pro

- Rufus/balenaEtcher USB Flashers (Use 1 of them): Get Rufus: https://rufus.ie/en/ | Get balenaEtcher: https://www.balena.io/etcher/

- Windows 11 Lite build(s)

- USB flash drive with at least 8GB of free space

if you fail to meet the requirements the OS may still install but you may suffer unexpected issues (these changes will change in later updates).

This build also includes the "UCMCLIENT" driver that microsoft cant find unless you use 3rd party driver installers, nither ASUS provides the driver for this built-in hardware component. This build also removes bloatware from installing and they cannot reinstall no matter what unless you manually choose too. This build includes the default basic media graphics driver they provide automatically and will install your GPU driver automatically.

HOW TO INSTALL:

To install use either Rufus or balenaEtcher flash the ISO for now we will use rufus since balenaEtcher does it already automatically.

On RUFUS plug in your usb flash drive (8GB) and then press the select button to load your ISO. Once your ISO has been loaded ensure the below options are set to "GPT" and "UEFI (non CSM)" and then the file system format is on "NTFS" then click start (this will take some time to do, so please wait) you will know its done it will make a sound and the progress bar will show as DONE.
