Windows 11 Lite is a new version of Windows that gets rid
 of not only bloatware but as well free up RAM and better performance and better CPU I/O Scheduling

WARNING FROM THE DEVELOPER(S):
The developer & microsoft takes no responsibilities for any damages this mod may do to either your software or hardware, you agree by downloading and installing this mod that you are fully held responsible for all damages that ouccured to your system by using this mod, though this may not happen, nothing is impossible. So please ensure you are aware on how to install windows and backup all sensitive files before installing this mod. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!



BEFORE YOU GET STARTED:

To get started you will need the following files/hardware to install this version of Windows 11 Pro

- Rufus/balenaEtcher USB Flashers (Use 1 of them): Get Rufus: https://rufus.ie/en/ | Get balenaEtcher: https://www.balena.io/etcher/

- Windows 11 Pro v1 x64 Lite iso: 

- USB flash drive with at least 8GB of free space

if you fail to meet the requirements the OS may still install but you may suffer unexpected issues (these changes will change in later updates).

This build also includes the "UCMCLIENT" driver that microsoft cant find unless you use 3rd party driver installers, nither ASUS provides the driver for this built-in hardware component. This build also removes bloatware from installing and they cannot reinstall no matter what unless you manually choose too. This build includes the default basic media graphics driver they provide automatically and will install your GPU driver automatically.


HOW TO INSTALL:

To install use either Rufus or balenaEtcher flash the ISO for now we will use rufus since balenaEtcher does it already automatically.

On RUFUS plug in your usb flash drive (8GB) and then press the select button to load your ISO. Once your ISO has been loaded ensure the below options are set to "GPT" and "UEFI (non CSM)" and then the file system format is on "NTFS" then click start (this will take some time to do, so please wait) you will know its done it will make a sound and the progress bar will show as DONE.
